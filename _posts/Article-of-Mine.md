自己写的一个小文章，感觉不错就发上来了。

Back to the time when I was in high school. One day, I was so disappointed because I spent a lot of time and effort on the physics group project, but my partner did not help much. I complained it with my dad. To my surprise, he was like:” We all have our own advantages and shortcomings. Never measure others corn by one's own bushel. We should use our advantages to help each other instead of criticizing” That made me realize that people are different from each other, I like challenging myself do not mean everyone should be like that. Since then, I started to learn how to think other problem on theirs positions. Then I found that it is a good way to get a better understanding of my friends and effectively help them. 
I learned time management skill from my mom. When I was complaining about teacher assigned us too much homework, she told me that:” Why don’t you finish your homework before you start playing computer games? “ I was stunned by these words. She continued:” Every one has 24 hours each day. But why others can allocate them properly between work, entrainment? The key is do the things that we unwilling to do first. Then we can have a much easier plan for the day. Always remember to be the lord of your life, don’t become the slave of your own time.” Because of these word, I started to try to be an early bird, and that influenced me a lot.
